# Report for Assignment 1

## Project chosen

Name: pybrain

URL: https://github.com/pybrain/pybrain

Number of lines of code and the tool used to count it: 27148 (lizard)

Programming language: Python

## Coverage measurement

### Existing tool

We used Coverage.py as the existing tool to check the coverage of our forked project.
It was executed by the command `coverage run -m unittest discover `

### Your own coverage tool
#### Celal Turkmen
semilinear(x) and explnPrime(x) from pybrain/tools/functions.py \
[Relevant commit](https://github.com/24x6fhy/SEP_pybrain/commit/4f6d168feb45c2e99709aa0c82eaede21168f136) \
Code output: \
![Celal Coverage](sources/celal_coverage.png)

#### Enis Kerem Cakmak
addData(self, id0, x, y) and setLineStyle(self, id=None, **kwargs) from pybrain\tools\plotting\multiline.py \

## Coverage improvement

### Individual tests

#### Celal Turkmen

Note: Test 1 & 2 are both in the same file, so I did not make it separately.
[Relevant commit](https://github.com/24x6fhy/SEP_pybrain/commit/7a086fb7b8edb133ca4311066f875acf8ada334f) \

New coverage: \
![New Coverage](sources/celal_improvement.png)

Covered statements are increased from 10753 to 10797. This is because test_celal.py file under test/unittest folder includes some test cases covering the statements in tools/functions.py.

#### Enis Kerem Cakmak

Note: Test 1 & 2 are both in the same file, that is, multiline.py.
[Relevant commit](https://github.com/24x6fhy/SEP_pybrain/commit/8638ffb2020cae48d70d25936c0262559df276e0) \

As it is seen from the screenshots, the coverage is improved from 10753 to 10822 as a result of the new test cases added under pybrain\tests\unittests\tools\test_enis.py covering the selected function statements in pybrain\tools\plotting\multiline.py.
